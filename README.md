# Change log


## Change log v0.09-B1:

- Fixed bug:
    - Re-fixed the Discord button. Should work fine now.


## Change log v0.09:

- Cards:
	- Added weighted RNG to get more movement cards for now
	- Sword/Attack cards will get up on the 5th level, but they won't work

- Levels:
	- Added another level, although the enemies (red squares) don't work (still WIP)
	
- Known bug(s):
	- All arrow sprites vanish after a move card is used
	- PG demo in "Levels" under "Secret UI" doesn't show any PG content.

- Fixed bug(s):
	- Discord button now redirects you to the server, instead of discord.com
	- Instead of waiting for the welcome splash text to disappear, added a button.


## Change log v0.08(First public beta!):

- Main menu:
	- Added a Discord button that redirects to [Dungeon's Entrance](https://discord.gg/invite/MBeE9krznG/)

- Levels(Game levels scene):
	- Added two more levels
	- Added a hand reset tile
	- Added end text

- Cards:
	- Added 5 more card slots, intended for higher chances of getting movement cards.
	- Movement cards now have an arrow that shows the direction of the card.

- Other:
	- Added instructions for players
	- Old Main Menu UI is now Secret UI
	- New Main Menu UI
	- Added sounds
	- Public beta is up!

## Change log v0.07-B1 :

- Bugfix:
	- The main menu now shows the appropriate "Main Menu UI" layer instead of the "Game Mechanics UI" at the start of the game.

- Version numbering:
	- Version numbers are now going to be prefixed with a bugfix number extension, `-Bx`, to differentiate bugfixes and the potentials problems they may cause. Any change to the existing game beyond a drop-in bugfix, like a mechanics change, is always a version number increment.

## Change log v0.07b :

- Cards:
	- Managed to get a small card system, with animations. (:tada:)

- Levels:
	- Added a new scene, called "Game Levels", where we can build custom levels for the public beta.

Notes: I hope we can push everything tomorrow to the main branch of the game. I am going to do a cleanup of unnecessary files (unused sprites files) and, after making a few levels to show others our card system, we can publish it.

## Change log v0.07a :

- Player:
	- Made a separate Player object for the mechanics of the game
	- Player object now has custom movement and collision (toggleable collision hitbox)

Making of the card system is going to be a bit complicated, especially as beginners. *Hoping someone is kind enough to help us on the house. (You can find the Discord invite above the Change log)* 

## Change log v0.05 / v0.06 :

- Main menu changes:
	- Menu's scene's code cleaned up (Thanks to Seven)
	- Added Procedurally Generated Demo (PGD) settings

- Other changes:
	- Started using structures for different things, just to keep things more organized
	- Tidied up the main menu code a bit more
	


## Change log v0.04 :

- Main Menu changes:
	- Added a Levels button for the types of level
	- Added a Game mechanic button for game mechanics
	- Added settings buttons for the simple dungeon generation(WIP) and noise generation
	- All of the above will be temporary, as we're going to remove them once we publish the game.

- First levels:
	- Player now snaps to grid once teleported

- Other Mechanics:
	- Escape key now closes the game
	- Added back buttons for every scene
	- Added the card mechanic
		- You can randomize the direction of cards by pressing on the card laid on its back
		- You can't move the player by using the keyboard
		- Added a collision "box", which won't work in this version, but might do in later versions.
	
- Events/Interactions:
	- "is pressed" event is going to be used instead of "is clicked"
	- Instead of using "on_mainMenu" or similar variables, we can use the "Visibility of a layer" function

## Change log v0.03 :

  -  most objects are now global objects
  -  most objects have a sprite and tile equivalent (sprite is for DungeonGenerator, and tile is for manually designing rooms)
  -  added a version number to the menu screen

New version number system: increment the version number +0.01 per 'release'
